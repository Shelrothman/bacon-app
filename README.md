## Description

Has this ever happened to you?

Picture this; you are watching a movie and you see an actor and you think "oh my goodness how do I know that actor!? I know I have seen them elsewhere but where!? It is on the tip of my tongue..." 

If so, this app is for you. With a couple taps of your thumb, your 'tip of tongue syndrome' (aka _lethologica_) will be cured! And perhaps more fuel for your curiosity will follow. Keep diving into the rabbit-hole, to infinity and beyond! 


### How to use the App
1. Enter a movie title or actor name to search
2. Select an actor from the list to view their movies.
3. Select a movie from that list, to view the cast.
4. Click on the movie title to view its plot or the actor name to view their picture.
5. Keep going till your hearts content.
